# Install Micro SD Card

## Overview

In Matrix OS 3, a Micro SD card is required to enable Python application functionality, and it is also required for the Sequencer App to save your sequences. This guide will walk you through the process of installing a Micro SD card into your Mystrix device.

:::info Mystrix 2 Users
Mystrix 2 devices come preloaded with a SD card. This page only applies to Mystrix 1 family devices.
:::

## Requirements

- **Micro SD Card**: Any size (minimum 1GB recommended)
- **File System**: Must be formatted as FAT32
- **Tools**: Small Phillips head screwdriver
- **Time**: Approximately 10-15 minutes

:::warning Important
Ensure your Mystrix device is powered off and disconnected from all cables before beginning the installation process.
:::

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Prepare the SD Card

Before installing the SD card, ensure it is properly formatted:

1. **Format the SD Card**: The card must be formatted as FAT32
   - On Windows: Right-click the SD card in File Explorer → Format → Select "FAT32"
   - On macOS: Use Disk Utility → Erase → Select "MS-DOS (FAT)"
   - On Linux: Use `mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sdX` (replace X with your device)

2. **Verify Format**: Confirm the SD card shows as FAT32 format before proceeding

### Step 2: Access the Internal Hardware

To install the Micro SD card, you'll need to open the Mystrix device:

1. **Power Off**: Ensure the device is completely powered off
2. **Remove Screws**: Carefully remove all **16 screws** from the back panel using a small Phillips head screwdriver
3. **Keep Screws Safe**: Place all screws in a small container to prevent loss
4. **Remove Back Panel**: Gently lift off the back panel to access the internal components

:::warning Screw warning
The screws are a bit fragile. Please be careful and do not strip them.

If you need replacements, the screw spec is **M2.3x8 self-tapping sinkhead flat head**.

If replacement parts are required, please [contact us](/docs/Support/ConnectWithUs).

:::caution Handle with Care
Take care when handling the internal components. Avoid touching circuit boards or sensitive components.

### Step 3: Locate the SD Card Slot

Once the back panel is removed:

1. **Identify the Slot**: Locate the Micro SD card slot on the main board
2. **Check Orientation**: Note the correct orientation for SD card insertion (usually marked on the board)

### Step 4: Insert the SD Card

1. **Orient Correctly**: Ensure the SD card is oriented properly. See the attached image for example
2. **Insert Gently**: Carefully slide the Micro SD card into the slot until it clicks into place
3. **Verify Secure**: Ensure the card is fully seated and secure in the slot

### Step 5: Reassemble the Device

1. **Replace Back Panel**: Carefully position the back panel back onto the device
2. **Reinstall Screws**: Replace all 16 screws, tightening them securely but not over-tightening
3. **Final Check**: Ensure all screws are properly installed and the panel is flush

## Verification

After installation, verify the SD card is working properly:

1. **Power On**: Turn on your Mystrix device
2. **Check Device Settings**: Go to Device Settings and check if the USB Storage Mode button is lit up
3. **Test Python Apps**: Try installing or running a Python application to confirm functionality


## Important Notes

- **Backup**: Always backup important data before formatting the SD card
- **Quality**: Use a reliable, brand-name Micro SD card for best performance
- **Speed**: Class 10 or higher SD cards are recommended for optimal performance
- **Size**: While any size works, 8GB or larger provides ample space for Python applications


## Next Steps

Once your SD card is installed and working:

1. Try some of the included Python example applications
2. Explore the [Python Application Development](../Developer/PythonApplication) documentation
3. Consider developing your own custom Python applications
